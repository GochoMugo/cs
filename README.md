> **Computer Science**


## principles:

**Who start such a project?** I have been a Computer Science student in Kenya.
In developing countries, our education systems tends to be very sub-standard.
Sub-standard, in that it does not match to those in developed countries.
This eventually means that most times, we are dragging behind in our
technology and expertise. And since this is a mostly a dog-eat-dog society,
we can not wait for superior countries to help achieve these high standards.
This fact disturbed me long enough to stop complaining about it and try do
something about it. This project, to me, is a free gift to all the aspiring
computer scientists in Kenya and other developing countries.

**So what is the main aim of this project?** To teach the Computer Science
fundamentals, while showing the relevance with real-world scenarios. Using
in-depth research, through scientific papers, journals, etc., elaborate
source code and a no-bullshit, straight-to-the-point attitude, the project
wishes to reach a particular audience. This is not for everyone. It is for
those of us, who believe in learning, free information and Computer
Science.

**Is this a book?** No. This is a project meant to supplement actual computer
science courses and books. It allows the student, after an introduction to
some concept, to divulge deeper and gain better understanding, especially
from a scientific viewpoint. It requires as an encyclopedic approach.

**I hear you! Now take my money!** This project is in all manner possible,
**free**. You are free to use it, copy it, distribute it, burn it. That's your
frigging choice. All the sources of information have been carefully selected
for their correctness, but mostly to ensure they are available at
**zero cost**. Under our organisation, we are willing to receive donations
for the sole purpose of advancing the project, especially in disseminating
the information to more remote areas in developed countries.
