## background:

**Why start such a project?**
This project serves as a useful resource for Computer Science students,
particularly those in developing countries. It hopes to bridge the gap
between theoretical concepts and their practicability, in a bid to promote
real-world implementation and innovation.

**Is this a book?** No. This is a project meant to supplement actual computer
science courses and books. It allows the student, after an introduction to
some concept, to divulge deeper and gain better understanding, especially
from a scientific viewpoint. It requires as an encyclopedic approach.

**I hear you! Now take my money!** This project is in all manner possible,
**free**. You are free to use it, copy it, distribute it, burn it. That's your
choice. All the sources of information have been carefully selected
for their correctness, but mostly to ensure they are available at
**zero cost**.
