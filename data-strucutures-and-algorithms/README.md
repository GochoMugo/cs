# data structure and algorithms

* asymptotic analysis - method of measuring the inherent difficulty of a
  problem and analysing efficiency of an algorithm seeking to solve such
  problems.
* An algorithm is efficient if it solved the problem within the required
  resource constraints
* Cost of an algo - amount of resources the solution consumes
* cost of one key resource, such as time, is measured at a time, with the
  assumption that it meets the other resource constraints
* every data structure has its purposes, its niche it seeks to solve. Thus,
  no data structure is entirely better than other, except in a specific
  problem domain.

* type - collection of values e.g boolean. It is a set
    * simple type - no sub-parts
    * composite/aggregate type - has sub-parts e.g. record
* data type - a type together with the collections of operations allowed on
  the type  << is array a data type or an implementation >>
* abstract data type (ADT) - a data type with a formalized interface,
  encapsulating any implementation details. It is particularly viewed
  as a software component, with its << what is encapsulation, abstraction >>
* data item - member of a type
* data structure - implementation of an ADT
* data type = ADT + data structure

* problem - mapping of inputs to output (function)
* algorithm - recipe for solving a problem (correct, concrete, finite steps,
  unambiguous)
* exact-match query, range query
* design patterns
