# Dice simulation

We are simulating the simple act of rolling a 6-sided dice
and recording the frequency at which each face turns up, for a
given number of rolling rounds (by default, `1000`). The application
is written in Java, and its source code can be found in `app/`.

More information on the simulation process can be found in
`report/report.md`.
